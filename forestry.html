                1. Executive Summary
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The paper argues that global climate strategies are dangerously over-reliant on the assumption that forests will remain stable, permanent carbon sinks. It demonstrates that the increasing vulnerability of forests to disturbances (like fires, pests, and deforestation) poses a massive economic threat to achieving the Paris Agreement's climate goals. The central finding is that <strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">delaying policy action</strong> to compensate for forest carbon loss, even by just five years, <strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">doubles the economic cost and effort</strong> required across all sectors to stay on track, making a proactive "hedge" an urgent economic necessity.</p>

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Forest Permanence:</strong> The core idea that carbon sequestered in forests must <em>stay there</em> for the long term to be effective in mitigating climate change. The paper challenges the assumption that this permanence is guaranteed.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR):</strong> The process of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Regrowing forests is currently the most significant and low-cost form of CDR.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Myopic vs. Foresighted Policy:</strong>
                    <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-6">
                        <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Foresighted (Proactive):</strong> Policies that anticipate potential forest loss and implement broader, immediate decarbonization efforts as a safeguard.</li>
                        <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Myopic (Reactive):</strong> Policies that wait for forest loss to become evident before reacting, forcing more drastic and expensive measures later.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Mitigation Pathways:</strong> The strategic routes and scenarios modeled to reduce emissions and limit global warming to targets like 1.5Â°C.</li>

                3. Core Problem Investigated
            </h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Climate models (Integrated Assessment Models or IAMs) often underestimate major forest disturbances. The study asks: What are the economic consequences if forests lose carbon at a higher rate than we currently plan for, and how do the costs differ if we plan for this risk versus reacting to it after the fact?</p>

            </h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Modeling:</strong> The study uses a global multi-sectoral model (REMIND-MAgPIE) that links the economy, energy systems, and land use.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Scenarios:</strong> Researchers introduced a range of "stylized disturbance rates" (e.g., losing 0.4% of forest carbon per year) into the model.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Comparison:</strong> They compared the economic outcomes of a <strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">"Foresighted"</strong> policy response (acting immediately) versus a <strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">"Myopic"</strong> policy response (delaying action by 5 or 10 years).</li>

            </h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed space-y-2">
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">The Cost of Delay is Exponential:</strong> A myopic, five-year delay in responding to forest carbon loss <strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">more than doubles the additional mitigation costs</strong> and the land area required for CDR compared to a foresighted response.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Proaction is Cheaper than Reaction:</strong> A myopic (late) response to a specific rate of forest loss is <strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">as stringent, or even more demanding, than an immediate, foresighted response to <em>twice</em> the rate of forest loss.</strong> This highlights that preparing for risk is far more efficient than reacting to a crisis.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Burden Shifts to Other Sectors:</strong> When forests fail to absorb the expected CO2, the burden shifts. The energy, industry, and transport sectors must implement much more severe and costly emission reductions to compensate.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Increased Reliance on Technology:</strong> Myopic policies lead to a much steeper and more expensive ramp-up of technical CDR solutions (like BECCS and DACCS) later in the century.</li>

            </h2>

                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Urgent Need to Hedge:</strong> We cannot afford to simply bet on forests. Global climate policy must treat forest permanence as a significant risk and implement stronger, immediate decarbonization efforts in other sectors as a safeguard.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Monitor and Protect Forests:</strong> The results underscore the urgent economic need to not only monitor forest health globally but also to invest in safeguarding them from disturbances.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-extrabold text-blue-641-c">Integrate Risk into Models:</strong> Climate and economic models must be updated to include more realistic projections of forest disturbances to avoid dangerously optimistic and economically fragile mitigation plans.</li>
